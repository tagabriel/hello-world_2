# Reviewing how to use GitHub.

tagabriel here, just trying to learn how to use GitHub. I am basically a self-taught programmer with a nearly completed degree in elecrical engineering that was interrupted by life changes a couple decades ago. I have spent the last 4 years learning the Android platform, SDK and Java language. I hope to put all this knowledge to work one day designing apps or working collaboratively on other Android projects.
